How do I set the PATH permanently?

To set the PATH permanently, add the full path of the jdk1.6.0_<version>\bindirectory to the PATH variable. Typically this full path looks somethinglike C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_<version>\bin. Setthe PATH as follows on Microsoft Windows:

Click Start > Control Panel > System on Windows XP or Start > Settings > Control Panel > System on Windows 2000.
Click Advanced > Environment Variables.
Add the location of bin folder of JDK installation for PATH in Use
